- Sketch ideas and potential markups of visualizations for the dashboard.
- Clearly outline the goals and objectives of the dashboard and identify the key metrics and insights the dashboard should provide.

Second Week:
- Begin creating initial ggplot visualizations of our proposed sketches as well as create visualizations without consideration of our sketch.
- Iterate on the visualizations and get feedback from each other.
- Refine the visualization and ideas based on insights gained from the analysis and make changes based on feedback.

Third Week:
- Consider the visual appearance and layout of the dashboard and implement visualizations.
- Ensure data is formatted appropriately for different visualizations and implementation.
- Conduct thorough testing of the dashboardâ€™s functionality and debug any issues to ensure a smooth user experience.

Final Week:
- Collect feedback on our dashboard.
- Make final adjustments to the layout, color scheme, overall design, and possible changes based on feedback.
- Evaluate user interface for user interface and clarity.
- Publish the final dashboard.
